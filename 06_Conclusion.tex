In this study, we address two main challenges in executing large-scale workflow ensembles in public clouds: (1) execution coordination, and (2) resource provisioning. We present our solutions to these challenges with the development of DEWE v2, a pulling-based workflow management system, and its effective resource provisioning strategy. 
By adopting the pulling approach in our solution system, we have demonstrated that much of scheduling overhead when executing a large-scale workflow ensemble particularly in public clouds can be removed as a majority of tasks in scientific workflows often exhibit homogeneity in their resource consumption pattern and acquiring a large number of homogeneous public cloud resources is easily possible. We compare the performance of DEWE v2 with Pegasus showing DEWE v2 is capable of achieving 80\% speed-up. We have also demonstrated that provisioning cloud resources using our profiling-based strategy based on performance index is very effective in terms of both cost and deadline compliance.
